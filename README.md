OpenFoam tutorials

Here you will find various tutorials for openFoam to simulate heat transfer problems. Mainly I will focus on the different aspects of heat conduction and heat convection. It is unlikely that I will include radiation.

You will also find here all the necessary case files. At the moment I'm using OpenFoam-7 at the moment.

All the tutorials and case files are prepared by me. You can use them freely under the CC-A-NC-SA licence (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike). If you want anything else let me know.
